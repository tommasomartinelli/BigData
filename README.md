A spark and ray application, developed in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment, to compare and analyze these two popular parallel computing frameworks for a machine learning task. 

## Project Goals
The 'Rain in Australia' dataset, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package), is a dataset containing approximately 10 years of daily weather observations recorded from many locations in Australia. The 23 features, in fact, tell the meteorological characteristics of a typical Australian day: humidity percentage, wind direction, wind speed, daily temperature at different times of the day, etcâ€¦
The purpose of the dataset is to make binary classification on the 'Rain_Tomorrow' label, i.e. being able to predict whether, on the day following the one for which the features were collected, it will rain or not, therefore RainTomorrow=1 (it will rain), or RainTomorrow =0 (it will not rain).

A total of five scripts were made, the first two relating to the part in Ray, the last three relating to Spark. Each script represents a different configuration with which they were developed. We wanted to implement horizontal scalability for Spark, thus adding more nodes to the cluster, while we used a vertical approach for Ray, building a very powerful machine in terms of calculation:

[1. Script Ray](/src/ray/RayOnGCP.ipynb): Local development on VM, with data loading done via HDFS.
2. Script Ray: Development on GCP, with a VM consisting of 16 vCPUs and 60 GB of RAM.

1. Spark Scripts: Local development via VM, with data load done via HDFS.
2. Spark Script: Developing on GCP, with a cluster consisting of 1 master and 3 workers, each having 2 vCPUs and 7.5GB of RAM.
3. Spark Script: Development on GCP, with a cluster composed by 1 master and 3 workers, each of them having 4 vCPUs and 15 GB of RAM.
