A spark and ray application, developed in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment, to compare and analyze these two popular parallel computing frameworks for a machine learning task. 

## Project Goals
The 'Rain in Australia' dataset, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package), is a dataset containing approximately 10 years of daily weather observations recorded from many locations in Australia. The 23 features, in fact, tell the meteorological characteristics of a typical Australian day: humidity percentage, wind direction, wind speed, daily temperature at different times of the day, etcâ€¦
The purpose of the dataset is to make binary classification on the 'Rain_Tomorrow' label, i.e. being able to predict whether, on the day following the one for which the features were collected, it will rain or not, therefore RainTomorrow=1 (it will rain), or RainTomorrow =0 (it will not rain).
